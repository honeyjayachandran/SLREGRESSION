1) Calories_consumed-> predict weight gained using calories consumed
2) Delivery_time -> Predict delivery time using sorting time 
3) Emp_data -> Build a prediction model for Churn_out_rate 
4) Salary_hike -> Build a prediction model for Salary_hike


Do the necessary transformations for input variables for getting better R^2 value for the model prepared.


answrers

1)

+no need for transformation even after logritmic and exponential transformation rmse value is higher and r sqred value
is lower

weight gained =-625.752+0.42016(calorie consumed)
correlation=0.946991
multiple rsqred=0.8968
rmse=103.3025

2)
exponential model is correct as it has rmse lower and rsqured higher than other model
delivery time=2.12137+0.1055(sorting time)
correlation=0.8431773
multiple r squred=0.7109
rmse=0.1669628

3)
polynomial model is correct
churnouttime=6.638e+00-1.396e-03(salary hike)
correlation=-0.925803
rmse=0
multiple r sqred =3.541549

4)
QUADRATIC MODEL
COR=0.9979683
RMSE=0
MULTIPLE R2 =1

SALARY=1.051E+01 +1.255E-01(YEARS EXPERIENCED)
